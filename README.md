# MailerLite - Hero Section Redesign

## Introduction

Welcome to the refreshed Hero Section for the MailerLite website. This repository showcases the revamped design, meticulously crafted to enhance user experience and accessibility.

It was created using vanilla HTML5 and CSS3 with the assistance of TailwindCSS. No JavaScript frameworks were utilized in accordance with the assignment specifications. However, if desired, I can recreate this design using any JavaScript framework of your choice, such as React.

### Features:

- Implemented using vanilla HTML5 and CSS3.
- Utilized TailwindCSS for streamlined styling.
- Emphasized ADA compliance.

### Code Abstractions:

To simplify maintenance and streamline the workflow, certain repetitive elements of the code, such as buttons and cards, have been encapsulated into custom classes using Tailwind's `@apply` directive. This abstraction is implemented directly at the CSS level and can be conveniently accessed at `/src/input.css`. By doing so, we ensure a cleaner workflow without reliance on JavaScript frameworks.

### Accessibility Considerations:

Special attention has been paid to addressing the current liabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) within MailerLite's live hero section. Detailed concerns and considerations are outlined in the comments within the Figma File.
